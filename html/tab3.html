<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><h5>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</h5></li>
  <p>
    According to the graphic we can see that all the time it looks very stable
    since almost the same amount of Kwh is spent every month, there was only a
    slight increase in month one, and in month four a slight decrease in Kwh
  </p>
  <li><h5>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</h5></li>
  <p>
      In month one it was the month in which energy was used the most compared 
      to the other months, from then on the energy used decreased and for this
       reason the linear regression in the graph shows us a noticeable decrease
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
      <h5>
        Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
        syntax in order to compute that.
      </h5>
    </li>

    $$ y=(-2.50)(6)+129.30=114.3 $$
    <p>
    R=/ It is estimated that next month 114.3 Kw will be consumed
    </p>
    <li>
     <h5>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
      remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
     </h5>
     <p>
        The average electricity consumption in the home ranges from 110 to 
        129 Kwh per month. This number can vary according to different 
        factors, for example: in month one of the graph there is a large 
        increase in light, because it is the month of December, for which 
        the lights are turned on and cause more expenses, of thereafter, 
        they return to an average, because daily activities are carried out
         normally, thus showing a decrease in the linear regression
    </p>
    </li>
  </p>
</ul>

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><h5>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</h5></li>
  <p>
      When we look at the table, we see that almost all respondents have
       three residents, there is only a minor variation of two and a brief
       increase of 4, but everyone still feels very even, which is reflected
       when looking at the number of points joined. Until one arrives that
       moves away in a very noticeable way (728Kwh and 8 residents) and 
      makes us observe a increasement and decreasement of the regression.</h5></li>
      <p>
  </p>
  <li><h5>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</h5></li>
  <p>
      The graph clearly shows us that the energy consumption of 3 people in a 
      home is the most frequent, but we also have two slight variations that 
      make our linear regression not straight, but show either growth or decrease,
       but in our case it is a remarkable increasement
  </p>
  <li><h5>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that. </h5></li>
  <p>
    $$ y=(108.85)(200)+(-203.37)=21566.63 $$
    R=/ In a residential unit, where 200 people live, it is estimated to consume 
    21566.63 Kwh
  </p>

  <li><h5>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
      between these two variables.
    </h5></li>
    <p>
        It can be seen that the graph has energy costs that oscillate between
        98 and 140 Kwh, it is stable; and the residents are also in a similar
        range, between 2 and 4 people.
        However, this has a sudden change at one point, since there is a household
        that has 8 residents and uses 728 Kwh, which makes the linear regression
        grow rapidly.
    </p>
</ul>
