<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
  For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic 
  displays that behavior in terms of:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><h5>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</h5></li>
        <p>
            Compared to previous months, in the month of April there is a notable
             growth of KWH, In turn, in the month of February there was a growth 
             of KWH but not so notable
      </p>

      <li><h5>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</h5></li>
        <p>
            What is shown is that, as the months progress, the KWH usage is 
            higher, however, it is still inconstant, that is, it increases 
            and decreases, in a way that it increases more than it decreases.
       </p>

      <li><h5>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month.
         Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>

       <p>
      $$ y=(16.20)(6)+(-15.60)=81.6 $$
      </p>
    
        <li><h5>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should 
          reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</h5></li>
          <p>
              One way to reduce the use of electrical energy is by disconnecting
              all electronic devices that are not being used, or by reducing the
              time they are used, and to conclude, we can say that during the 
              months of December and January it is a very low use of KWH due to
              the fact that those times are for parties and studies, and the 
              following months, you can see a variation between February, March
              and April, which is due to the fact that my mother works in person 
              and virtually, and constantly has changes of schedules every month 
          </p>

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
<p id="eanalysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic 
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><h5>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</h5></li>
    <p>
        We can see how there is an inconstancy, and a peculiarity in the KWH
        expense, and that is that there are some people who, even if they 
        live with few people, can generate a higher KWH expense than can 
        generate up to 4 people together, however, it does not show how the
        graph tends to be increasing
    </p>
    <li><h5>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</h5></li>
    <p>
        What the graph shows us is that HWK consumption will not always
        depend on the number of people living in the same household, 
        since 2 people who have many virtual tasks or spend a lot of 
        time at home may spend more HWK that 4 people who are hardly 
        at home, even so, it shows us how the graph tends to show that
        the more people, the more KWH are used in a house
    </p>
     <li><h5>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential 
       unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute 
       that.</h5></li>
       <p>
         $$ y=(82.11)(200)+(-125.74)=16296.26 $$
      </p>
     <li><h5>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given 
       that relation between these two variables.</h5></li>
       <p>
          Here is a situation, and it is that the regression line shows us
          that the more people there are in a house, the more KWH are spent,
          even so, it does not always mean this, since there may be fewer
          people who need to do a greater use of the different electronic
          devices that generate an expense of KWH, but, generally, a 
          greater number of people, generates a greater expense, therefore,
          this relation is given, since the expense that occurs in KWH varies,
          among people those who are few in the same house but use a lot of 
          electricity, and among those who are many people in the same house
          but who do not use as much energy.
