<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
  Trough the following work, some concepts will be explained, making use of different technological tools such as codes and platforms such as Github and Codesandbox.
</p>
<h4>CONCEPTS OF THIS PROJECT</h4>
<h4>Electric energy</h4>
<p>
    Electrical energy is the energy derived from electric potential energy or kinetic energy of the charged particles. In general, it is referred to as the energy that has been converted from electric potential energy. We can define electrical energy as the energy generated by the movement of electrons from one point to another. The movement of charged particles along/through a medium (say wire) constitute current or electricity.
</p>
<h5>Formula: </h5>
<p>
    The electrical energy P is the product between the voltage V at the terminals (in volts) and the current that passes through it (in amperes):
  </p>

   <li> P = V × I </li>
  <p>
   The unit of power is the Watt (W).
  </p>
<p>
    The electrical energy consumed by an electrical appliance is the product of electrical power (P) and the duration of time used (t)
</p>

    <li> E = P × t </li>
   <p> 
    The unit of energy is the Joule (J). Another unit used is the watt-hour (Wh). 1 WH = 3600 J
</p>

<h5>Example: </h5>
  <p>
      In a car battery, a chemical reaction results in the formation of an electron which possesses the energy to move in an electric current. These moving charges provide electrical energy to the circuits in the car.

<h4>Watt (physical energy)</h4>
<p>
  Is the International System of Units' (SI) standard unit of power (energy per
  unit time), the equivalent of one joule per second. The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy isdissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or dissipated.

<li>W: Power </li>
  <li>  V: Voltage </li>
  <li>  i: Current </li>

<h4>Scatter plot</h4>
<p>
  Uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The
  position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for
  an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships
  between variables.

<h4>Linear regression</h4>
<p>
  Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on
  the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the
  dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's
  value is called the independent variable.

<h5> In the above figure: </h5>

  
<li> X-axis = Independent variable </li>
    <li> Y-axis = Output / dependent variable </li>
        <li> Line of regression = Best fit line for a model</li>

  <h4>Renewable energy</h4>
  <p>
    Is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate
    than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources
    that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are
    plentiful and all around us.

  <li> Wind energy</li>
  <li> Geothermal energy</li>
  <li> Hidropower</li>
  <li> Ocean energy</li>
  <li> Bioenergy</li>
