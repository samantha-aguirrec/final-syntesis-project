<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <h5>
    <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  </h5>
  <p>
    According to the graphic, in my house there was a decrease because as the
    months passed the energy consumption decreased, except in the month of
    February when there was a notable increase.
  </p>
  <h5>
    <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  </h5>
  <p>
    The red points don´t have a defined behavior with respect to the regression
    line, because from the graphic it can be analyzed that the energy
    consumption is not stable, therefore, each month has a variation.
  </p>
  <h5>
    <li>
      Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
      syntax in order to compute that.
    </li>
  </h5>
  $$ y=(-5.90)(6)+178.90=143.5 $$
  <p>
    ANSWER: It is estimated that next month 143.5 KWH will be consumed.
  </p>
  <h5>
    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
      remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
    </li>
  </h5>
  <p>
    In conclusion, the energy consumption of my house has an average that
    oscillates between 158 KWH and 170 KWH, therefore, it remains stable, except
    in the month of February when there was an increase; and March, which was
    the month with the least consumption.
  </p>
  <p>
    Energy waste can be reduced in different ways, for example, turning off
    lights that are not needed, using daylight, unplugging cables that are not
    in use, opening windows and avoiding the use of air conditioning, etc.
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <h5>
    <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  </h5>
  <p>
    According to the graphic, there was an increase in energy, because the more
    people live in a house, the higher the consumption.
  </p>
  <h5>
    <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  </h5>
  <p>
    According to the relation between the dots with respect to the colors, it
    doesn´t matter how many people live in a house, because some families with
    few members spend more than families with more members and vice versa.
  </p>
  <h5>
    <li>
      Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where
      $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
    </li>
  </h5>
  $$ y=(82.11)(200)+(-125.74)=16296.26 $$
  <p>
    ANSWER: It is estimated that next month 16296.26 KWH will be consumed in a
    residential unit where 200 people live.
  </p>

  <h5>
    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
      between these two variables.
    </li>
  </h5>
  <p>
    The graphic is very scattered, and therefore does not have a defined
    behavior.
  </p>
  <p>Families of 2 and 4 members have a similar energy consumption.</p>
  <p>
    It can be seen that the more people live in a house, the higher the energy
    consumption, however, the family of 6 members is the one that spends the
    least, because they are more aware of saving energy and taking care of the
    environment.
  </p>
</ul>
